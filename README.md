# After reading Zen of python
The best sentences after reading Zen of Python:
1. Simple is better than complex
2. Now is better than never
```
I like these two quotes because they are really useful not only while programmin
g, but also during our daily life.
It's good to keep things simple and short while working, thus having great effic
iency.
When I'm in a bad mood, it would be like that everything is overwhelming me. It 
would be hard to start my work.
But if I don't start now, when will I do it? Things will get easier if I complet
e all the stuff that are on my mind.
Just like doing this homework, I started right away when I got it. I need course
 credits and everything is standing in my way.
